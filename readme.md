### November 4th, 2019
- added keyConfig.py script

Limited functionality right now. The script allows a user to select a 
controller, then remap the input buttons on it. Only works for one specific
type of controller and one specific system right now, and is heavily dependent
on the formatting of the emulator's config files.

### November 1st, 2019
- added startEmulator.py script

It takes a filename argument for a game, checks if the game exists, then
loads the required emulator and starts the game.
